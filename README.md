This project defines, justifies and shows the results of a Convolutional Neural Network for face alignment, the task of outlining facial landmarks from the image of a face.

There is a PDF report [here]() that discusses the solution defined.
There is a Python Notebook [here]() that displays the data manipulation performed and the training of the CNN.
