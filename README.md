# Face alignment with a CNN extracting HOG features and realistically coloring the lips

## About
This project defines, justifies and shows the results of a Convolutional Neural Network for face alignment, the task of outlining facial landmarks from the image of a face.

There is a PDF report [here](https://github.com/rzuberi/Face_Alignment_HOG_CNN/blob/main/Face%20Alignment%20and%20Colouring%20report.pdf) that discusses the solution defined.

There is a Python Notebook [here](https://github.com/rzuberi/Face_Alignment_HOG_CNN/blob/main/HOG_CNN_implementation_CV_Assignment_236636.ipynb) that displays the data manipulation performed and the training of the CNN.
